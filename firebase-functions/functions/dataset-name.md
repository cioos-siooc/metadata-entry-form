### Start

#### Dataset title:

- [ ] No version information in the title
- [ ] Include the geographical region the data apply to
- [ ] Does not include acronyms – put these in the keywords
- [ ] Does not include the word “dataset”

### Resource Identification

#### Abstract

- [ ] Abbreviations have been expanded upon at first mention
- [ ] Abstract describes how, when, what, where, why of data collection and is limited to no more than 500 words

#### DOI

- [ ] A DOI has been drafted for this record
- [ ] DOI has been updated via the form after review and changes to record
- [ ] DOI has been manually edited on datacite fabrica
- [ ] DOI status has been changed from Draft to Findable

### Spatial

- [ ] Ensure that Depth or Height Positive is correctly selected
- [ ] For Biological records a description of geographic extent is provided

### Contact

- [ ] ROR and ORCID(s) are included and linked properly where applicable
- [ ] For datasets where DFO is a partner, ensure 'parent' ROR is added (https://ror.org/02qa1x782). DFO 'child' organizations (i.e. CHS) and their ROR are optional.
- [ ] Include Hakai Institute as Publisher and include data@hakai.org as email
- [ ] Make sure email address is provided if the role is 'Metadata Custodian' or 'Point of Contact' 
- [ ] Add contact affiliation where known including ROR
- [ ] If resource is (partially) generated by Hakai researchers, include 'Tula Foundation' (with associated ROR) with 'Funder' role. Be sure to uncheck 'include in citation' for Tula Foundation.

### Data and Documentation

- [ ] Resource links go to specific dataset or package (not generic platform like waterproperties.ca)
- [ ] Readme, changelog, data dictionary, protocols included in data package (for tabular text based data)
- [ ] An archive folder, or other means, for older data versions is included if previous versions exist
- [ ] Links work
- [ ] All files in the data package can be opened and are not corrupt
- [ ] No executable files in the data package. Files should be open formats and standards (.csv, .txt for example)
